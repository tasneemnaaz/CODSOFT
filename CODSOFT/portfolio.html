            <h3>Quora duplicate question pair detection:</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning model to detect duplicate question pairs on Quora. Leveraged natural
                language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data, including tokenization, stemming, and
                vectorization. Engineered features such as TF-IDF vectors and word embeddings. Trained and
                evaluated models using various algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost
                classifier. Achieved high accuracy and precision in identifying duplicate questions, contributing to
                improved user experience and content organization on the platform using Python</p>
